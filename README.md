The project proposes the development of an automated system to convert coding tutorials or educational videos into well-structured, skimmable, and searchable written formats such as book chapters or blog posts. Inspired by Karpathy's post \cite{karpathyX}, the system leverages state-of-the-art tools like the Youtube API for audio transcription and Large Language Models (LLMs) for content translation to enhance video accessibility and readability.
The workflow comprises four key stages: transcription, segmentation, content translation, and export. The system begins by transcribing video audio using tools like the Youtube API, followed by segmenting the video into coherent sections with aligned text and code snippets. An LLM then transforms these segments into polished, written content optimized for clarity and searchability. Finally, the processed output is formatted with headings, subheadings, code snippets, and descriptions.
Challenges faced include accurate transcription of technical terms, precise video-text alignment, code extraction, code-to-section alignment, and effective LLM prompt engineering for content transformation. By addressing these challenges, the project aims to create a generalizable framework to convert any coding tutorial video into structured guides, making complex video tutorials more accessible to learners worldwide.
